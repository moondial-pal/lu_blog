		<h1><p style="text-align:center;"><u><b>Landscaping to Cloudscaping</b></u></h1>
		<br>
		<h2><p style="text-align:center;">Hello, and welcome!</h2> <h5><p style="text-align:center;">You may be curious about the title. I am in the landscape business and am essentially transitioning to 
			<br>
			predominantly dev/ops and cloud development work.
			<br>
			Navigate to "about" above if you would like to know my story.
			<br>
			<br>
			This is a very simple web app that I made with Google App Engine and flask w/python. I'd like to give 
			<br>
			a brief, general over view of the tools and different methods I used to develop this.
			<br>
			Also, this is my first experience with markdown - its honestly embarrassing. On the up side, I can only 
			<br>
			see it getting better.
			<br>
			<br>
			The main focus of this post is the process.
			<br>
			<br>
			<b><h3><p style="text-align:center;">Tools I used to deploy this web app</h3></b>
			<br>
			<br>
		<h5><ul><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Windows 10 OS -</b> Running on my lenovo laptop. My beloved work horse.</ul>
		<ul><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Sublime Text 3 -</b> To write code.
		</ul>
		<ul><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Git Bash terminal -</b> I use this to interact between github and my local code and machine.
		</ul>
	<ul><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Git Hub -</b> Open source, great for version control and for sharing code with other developers</ul>
<ul><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Google Cloud Platform -</b> GCP is a great platform, the almighty cloud whos services are to be leveraged.</ul>
<ul><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Google Cloud SDK -</b> A command line interface tool, such that once you get a hang of the gcloud syntax, it makes
<br>
developing with Google Cloud Platform more efficient.</ul>
<p style="text-align:center;">I like using the  The GCP console (User Inerface) it's great, but for this project I only popped in to the console just to check up on a few things.
<br>
<p style="text-align:center;">It is very convenient to be able to toggle back and forth.
<br>
Let's get started.
<br>
<br>
<p style="text-align:center;">Sublime Text 3 has been great to work with so far. I have one or two more text editors on my radar that I will be trying out.
<br>
For now Sublime is doing the trick just fine.
<br>
<p style="text-align:center;">First step is to write the code, and to be sure your files are structured properly for the flask frame work.
<br>
For instance, flask will specifically look for a folder "templates" and render the file specifed in that folder.
<br>
That way when a user clicks the "blog", "contact", or "about" tab there is something there.</h5>
<br>
<br>
<h5><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Below you can see the folder "</b>templates<b>" and files within, highlighted on the left.</b></h5>
<br>
<br>
<img src="{{url_for('static', filename='main.png')}}"  width="1500" height="700px" />
<br>
<br>
<h5><p style="text-align:center;">Google App Engine offers two types of environments that the code can be ran in.
<br>
Standard and Flexible.
<br>
For this very simple project, I am running the code in the standard environment.
<br>
<br>
<b>Below is what my "standard environment" app.yaml looks like.</b></h5>
<br>
<br>
<img src="{{url_for('static', filename='appyaml.png')}}"  width="1500" height="700px" />
<br>
<br>
<h5><p style="text-align:center;">Google has great documentation. I was able to confirm how the yaml file is written for the App Engine standard environment.
<br>
They give you the rundown quite well.
<br>
Notice their comments marked by a hashtag.
<br>
<br>
I'll also need to specify the version of flask required for the app in my "requirements.txt", also located in my working directory.</h5>
<br>
<br>
<img src="{{url_for('static', filename='reqtxt.png')}}"  width="1500" height="700px" />
<br>
<br>
<h5><p style="text-align:center;">
Now to open the Google Software Development Kit, aka the Google SDK.
<br>
If I was not using git hub to clone the repository, I would just access my local directory and place the files
<br>
(lu_blog folder) where I need it.
<br>
In this case my working directory or the folder
<br> I will be working out of is "'Cloud SDK'". For me this is located here,
<br>
C:\Users\User\'Cloud SDK'</h5>
<br>
<br>
<img src="{{url_for('static', filename='sdk.png')}}"  width="1500" height="150px" />
<br>
<br>
<h5><p style="text-align:center;">Good, now I have the code in my current working directory.</h5>
<br>
<br>
<h5><p style="text-align:center;">I like to confirm by scoping my directory simply with the dir command.
<br>
<b>"dir"</b></h5>
<br>
<br>
<img src="{{url_for('static', filename='sdkdirshow.png')}}"  width="1500" height="700px" />
<br>
<br>
<h5><p style="text-align:center;">Now I am going to change directory into our cloned repo. I'll use the cd command,
<br>
"cd lu_blog"</h5>
<br>
<br>
<img src="{{url_for('static', filename='cdlublog.png')}}"  width="1500" height="200px" />
<br>
<br>
<h5><p style="text-align:center;">Ok, now to deploy the code to Google App Engine.
<br>
"gcloud app deploy"</h5>
<br>
<br>
<img src="{{url_for('static', filename='apdeploy02.png')}}"  width="1500" height="100px" />
<br>
<br>
<h5><p style="text-align:center;">GCP will then spin up an instance, this will take a minute or two. It may ask to confirm services to deploy. I'll type "Y" to continue.</h5>
<br>
<br>
<img src="{{url_for('static', filename='conser02.png')}}"  width="1500" height="300px" />
<br>
<br>
<h5><p style="text-align:center;">App engine will proceed to deploy the web app to the following address https://blog-test-02.wl.r.appspot.com</h5>
<br>
<br>
<img src="{{url_for('static', filename='gapbro.png')}}"  width="1500" height="300px" />
<br>
<br>
<h5><p style="text-align:center;"><p style="text-align:center;">Now I will type the following to use the app in a browser.
<br>
<b>"gcloud app browse"</b></h5>
<br>
<br>
<img src="{{url_for('static', filename='gapbro1.png')}}"  width="1500" height="75px" />
<br>
<br>
<h5><p style="text-align:center;">When you input that command, a browswer window will open up with the web app...The app is up and running and if you are reading
<br>
this post, you are looking at an updated version. So this service is super helpful if you want to focus more on the code than the infrastructure.
<br>
Google App Engine helps in a big way with that, by splitting traffic, autoscaling and facilitating different methods of deployment.</h5>
